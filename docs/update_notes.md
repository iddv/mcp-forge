   - Implemented better server state tracking and error handling

2. **Request Validation**
   - Added comprehensive validation for all server creation parameters
   - Improved error reporting for invalid requests
   - Added validation for server names, capabilities, handlers, and options

3. **ID Generation System**
   - Implemented an improved ID generation system using UUIDs
   - Added timestamp components for better readability
   - Ensured uniqueness guarantees for server IDs

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Created a ConfigManager class for centralized configuration handling
