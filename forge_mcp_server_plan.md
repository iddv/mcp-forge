# MCP-Forge Implementation Plan and Tracker

## Project Overview
A forge for MCP servers that dynamically creates and manages child MCP servers on demand. Based on the windows-volume-control-mcp project, this framework will allow for the creation, management, and monitoring of specialized MCP servers through a centralized interface.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core MCP-Forge Server
- [x] Design server architecture
- [x] Implement base server class with MCP protocol support
- [x] Create server registry for tracking child instances
- [ ] Develop listener for incoming server creation requests
- [ ] Implement basic command handling

### Phase 2: Template-Based MCP Server Generator
- [x] Design template system architecture
- [x] Create base server template
- [x] Implement template parser and code generator
- [ ] Add template customization points
- [ ] Develop validation for template integrity

### Phase 3: Server Vending Mechanism
- [ ] Design API for server requests
- [x] Implement request validation
- [x] Create server instantiation logic
- [ ] Develop unique ID generation system
- [ ] Add configuration parameter handling

### Phase 4: Resource Management
- [x] Implement process tracking
- [x] Create resource monitoring system
- [ ] Develop graceful shutdown mechanisms
- [x] Add auto-scaling capabilities
- [ ] Implement resource limitation controls

### Phase 5: Configuration System
- [x] Design configuration format
- [x] Implement configuration parser
- [x] Create persistence mechanism
- [x] Add runtime reconfiguration capability
- [ ] Develop configuration validation

### Phase 6: Client API Development
- [x] Design API specification
- [x] Implement server listing endpoint
- [ ] Create server creation interface
- [ ] Add server management commands
- [x] Develop API documentation

### Phase 7: Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] Design centralized logging system
- [ ] Implement log aggregation
- [ ] Create status reporting mechanism
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Develop alerting for critical issues

### Phase 8: Security Implementation
- [ ] Design authentication system
- [ ] Implement request validation
- [ ] Add resource quota management
- [ ] Develop security audit logging
- [ ] Create vulnerability protection mechanisms
